# A-recurrent-neural-network-RNN-
A recurrent neural network or RNN is a deep neural network trained on sequential or time series data to create a machine learning (ML) model that can make sequential predictions or conclusions based on sequential inputs.

1. A vanilla RNN: is the simplest recurrent neural network that has an input vector, an output vector,and a recurrent unit or cell.

2. RNN (LSTM): Is an enhanced version of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber. LSTMs can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data making them ideal for tasks like language translation, speech recognition and time series forecasting.
